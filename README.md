## Module 2 Challenge - An interactive ordering system from a food truck menu
### The user will be asked to select a category from the menu. Then items froms that category will be shown for the user to select from. The user can then choose an number corresponding to the desired item. Next the user will be asked for a quantity of the selected item. The user then has the option to keep ordering additional items. After the user inputs that they would not like to continue, the program will print out their order and the total cost.
